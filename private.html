            When you use our Website, we collect and store your personal
            information which is provided by you from time to time. Our primary
            goal in doing so is to provide you a safe, efficient, smooth and
            customized experience. This allows us to provide services and
            features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our
            Website to make your experience safer and easier. More importantly,
            while doing so we collect personal information from you that we
            consider necessary for achieving this purpose. <br /><br />In
            general, you can browse the Website without telling us who you are
            or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give
            us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. Where
            possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are
            optional. You always have the option to not provide information by
            choosing not to use a particular service or feature on the Website.
            We may automatically track certain information about you based upon
            your behaviour on our Website. We use this information to do
            internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and
            behaviour to better understand, protect and serve our users. This
            information is compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis. This
            information may include the URL that you just came from (whether
            this URL is on our Website or not), which URL you next go to
            (whether this URL is on our Website or not), your computer browser
            information, and your IP address.<br /><br />
            We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of
            the Website to help analyse our web page flow, measure promotional
            effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small
            files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our
            services. We offer certain features that are only available through
            the use of a "cookie". <br /><br />We also use cookies to allow you
            to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can
            also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests.
            Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are
            automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.
            You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits,
            although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on
            the Website and you may be required to re-enter your password more
            frequently during a session. Additionally, you may encounter
            "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of the Website
            that are placed by third parties. We do not control the use of
            cookies by third parties. If you choose to buy on the Website, we
            collect information about your buying behaviour. If you transact
            with us, our PCI-DSS compliant payment gateway partner collect some
            additional information, such as a billing address, a credit / debit
            card number and a credit / debit card expiration date and/ or other
            payment instrument details. If you send us personal correspondence,
            such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send
            us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Website,
            we may collect such information into a file specific to you. We
            collect personally identifiable information (email address, name,
            phone number etc) from you when you set up a free account with us.
            While you can browse some sections of our Website without being a
            registered member, certain activities (such as browsing your deals)
            do require registration. We do use your contact information to send
            you offers based on your previous orders and your interests.
